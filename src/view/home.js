              It is important to view a recipe book as one that you use daily
              and what we in our family call "a living book" â€” a book that you
              use all the time, not just read once and discard on the shelf. It
              is in a sense a spell book, a book of magical enchantments, to be
              consulted, used and altered as needed.
